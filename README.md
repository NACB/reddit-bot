###### reddit bots created for CMC's CSCI040 class

## What did the bots do?
These bots ran a madlibs type text generator to create reddit comments promoting certain political candidates. Of the five bots I was running simultaneously, four created pro-Trump comments, and one generated pro-left comments. The text of these comments was inspired by the types of messages seen on fake social media accounts during the 2016 and 2020 elections.

#### Complications
These bots are fully functional, *which is not to say they ran perfectly smoothly*. After obtaining **over 800 valid comments _on each bot_**, the first subreddit being used was banned. After hitting **over 500**, the second subreddit was shut down. Additionally, on *some, but not all* of the bots, the number of valid comments generated began to decrease suddenly and unexpectedly. In light of this, please note that if you run the bot_counter.py file yourself, the number of comments may not exactly match those posted below. I continued to run the bots *after* obtaining the required 500 comments per bot in the hope of obtaining 1000 on any one of them. As a result, the outputs may be lower or higher than those saved and recorded below. 

## Photographic Evidence

## Optional work done
Many of the optional tasks were completed. These are listed below:
- 100 valid comments posted on one bot
- 500 valid comments posted on one bot
- 5 bots run simultaneously, each producing at least 500 valid comments

## Score?
